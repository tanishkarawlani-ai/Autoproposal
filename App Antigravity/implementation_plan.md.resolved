#### [NEW] [styles.css](file:///C:/Users/Tanishka%20Rawlani/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/auto-proposal/styles.css)
- Soft beige and pastel theme.
- Minimal modern layout with rounded cards and smooth transitions.
- Fully mobile responsive.

### Logic & Automation
#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///C:/Users/Tanishka%20Rawlani/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/auto-proposal/script.js)
- Manage state and fake 1-second loading animation.
- Basic templating engine leveraging plain JS dictionaries for different Collab Types and Tones.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Fill out the form fields and click 'Generate'.
- Observe the 1-second loading animation and the generated text.
- Verify that 'Copy' and 'Download as .txt' buttons work correctly.
- Ensure the layout is mobile responsive by resizing the browser window.
